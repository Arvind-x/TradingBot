  <h1>High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Simulator</h1>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This project aims to create a high-frequency trading simulator that replicates the behavior of automated trading strategies in financial markets. The simulator allows users to test and evaluate their trading algorithms using historical market data.
  </p>
  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Data Acquisition: Obtains historical market data from various sources to use for backtesting and simulation.</li>
    <li>Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the acquired market data to ensure its quality and compatibility with the simulator.</li>
    <li>Trading Strategies: Implements and simulates various trading strategies, such as statistical arbitrage, market-making, and pattern recognition.</li>
    <li>Order Execution Simulation: Simulates the order execution process, including order placement, order book modeling, order matching, and trade execution.</li>
    <li>Performance Evaluation: Calculates performance metrics and analytics to evaluate the simulated trading strategies, such as returns, risk measures, and Sharpe ratio.</li>
    <li>User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for configuring parameters, visualizing results, and monitoring the simulation progress.</li>
    <li>Testing and Validation: Thoroughly tests the simulator using historical data with known outcomes to validate the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results.</li>
    <li>Documentation and Presentation: Includes detailed documentation of the project, including design, implementation details, usage instructions, and assumptions made. Also prepares a presentation or demo to showcase the simulator's features and results.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Please note that building a high-frequency trading simulator is a complex task requiring knowledge of finance, trading strategies, and programming. It is recommended to start with simpler trading simulations before attempting high-frequency trading. Furthermore, legal and ethical considerations should be taken into account, and the use of real-time or live market data should be done with proper authorization.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please refer to the documentation for more information on how to set up and use the simulator effectively.
